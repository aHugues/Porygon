Loosely based on a MEAN full stack

Element | Technology
--- | ---
Database | MySQL
Database connection | Sequelize
Backend | Express
Frontend | Angular (v4)
CSS framework | Bootstrap 4 + Ng-Bootstrap


## Installation ##

No default values provided at the moment, so no installation method provided. 

You basically need to run `npm install` on both `backend/` and `frontend/` folders.

You will also need a working MySQL database.

## TODO ##

* Add default config files for easy install
* Add install procedure for possible replication
* Create missing documentation
